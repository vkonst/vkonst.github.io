  "name": "Iva",
  "description": "In Hebrew her name means `Gift from God` and in English `Climbing Ivy`.\nBorn from the underground village `MÅ«la` (meaning Root/Origin in Punjabi).\nFrom where she's from they don't count time, so it's unknown how old she is. Even though she looks and acts youthful, she learned the earth's wisdom from the town elders and has ancient knowledge running through her veins. She's always exploring, learning new things and sharing this with her friends and town elders. She can hear, or better yet feel the messages coming from the earth, which are guiding her and warn her when in danger. She gets along with most underground creatures although a lot call her a bit weird, for talking to the trees and the earth a lot.",
