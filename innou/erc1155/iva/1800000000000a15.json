Hanako translates to `Flower (hana) Child (ko)`.\nShe was 5 years old when she lost her mother, but she and her father remember her fondly and talk about her often. She's been a huge support to her father ever since the accident and when he lost his job. \nShe has a talent for getting into trouble, often taking on bullies twice her size. \nEven though she's not dumb, she has a hard time paying attention in school, often coming in late and not getting the best of grades. But she learns a lot from her father,who's stories she can listen to endlessly.",
